This problem calls for a Python function, `rearrange_digits`, that rearranges a list of digits into two numbers to maximize their sum. Importantly, the length of the two numbers cannot differ by more than one digit.

The design strategy for this problem begins by sorting the input list in descending order. The elements are then distributed one by one, from left to right, between the two numbers.

To achieve a time complexity of O(n*logn), we employ the merge sort algorithm, implemented in the `mergesort` function. This algorithm sorts an array by dividing it into two halves, sorting each half separately, and then merging them. The `mergesort` function uses a helper function, `merge`, to merge two sorted arrays.

The `mergesort` function divides the array into log n levels at most, and the merging operation at each level is O(n) time. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n*logn). The space complexity is O(n) because we need to create a new array to hold the merged array, which could be as large as the original array in the worst-case scenario.

The `rearrange_digits` function takes the result from `mergesort` and distributes each element to the two numbers. The time complexity is O(n) for traversing the array. The space complexity is O(1) for generating a new array that contains only two numbers.

In summary, the overall time complexity is O(nlogn), and the space complexity is O(n).
