In this problem, we used the RouteTrie (tree) data structure which provides several benefits:

## Benefits

- **Efficient Lookup**: 
  The RouteTrie allows for efficient lookup of routes. The time complexity for looking up a route is O(k), where k is the number of parts in the path. This is much more efficient than a linear search through a list of routes, which would have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of routes.

- **Space Efficiency**: 
  The RouteTrie is also space efficient. Each node in the trie only needs to store a reference to its children, rather than the entire route. This means that common prefixes in routes only need to be stored once, reducing the amount of memory required.

- **Flexibility**: 
  The RouteTrie allows for flexible matching of routes. For example, it could be easily extended to support wildcard routes (e.g., "/user/*") or optional parts of routes.

- **Scalability**: 
  The RouteTrie scales well as the number of routes increases. The time complexity for adding and looking up routes remains constant regardless of the number of routes, making it a good choice for large web applications with many routes.

In summary, the RouteTrie data structure provides an efficient and scalable way to manage web routes in a web server or application.

Complexity: 

RouteTrieNode Class: 
`__init__`: 
  - Time Complexity: O(1). Initializing an empty dictionary and a handler reference is a constant-time operation.
  - Space Complexity: O(1). The node itself and the empty dictionary take up constant space initially.
`insert`:
  - Time Complexity: O(1). Inserting into a dictionary typically has constant-time complexity.
  - Space Complexity: O(1). Only one new node is created.

RouteTrie Class: 
`__init__`(self, home_handler): 
  - Time Complexity: O(1) as creating the root node and assigning the handler takes constant time, regardless of the size of the trie.
  - Space Complexity: O(1) as only one root node is created.
`insert`(self, parts, handler): 
  - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of path segments. The method iterates through each segment of the path, potentially creating or traversing a node for each.
  - Space Complexity: O(n). In the worst case, a new node is created for each segment, leading to a linear space usage.
`find`(self, parts): 
  - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of path segments. The method traverses the trie, following the path segments.
  - Space Complexity: O(1). No new nodes are created during the search.

Router Class: 
`__init__`(self, root_handler, not_found_handler):
  - Time Complexity: O(1). Creating a RouteTrie instance and assigning handlers are constant-time operations.
  - Space Complexity: O(1). Only references are stored.  
`add_handler`(self, path, handler): 
  - Time Complexity: O(m + n), where m is the length of the path and n is the number of path segments. Splitting the path takes O(m) time, and inserting into the trie takes O(n) time.
  - Space Complexity: O(n). Space complexity is determined by the RouteTrie.insert method.
`lookup`(self, path):
  - Time Complexity: O(m + n). Similar to add_handler, path splitting is O(m) and trie lookup is O(n).
  - Space Complexity: O(n). This is because the split_path method creates a new list of the parts of the path, which takes up space in memory.
`split_path`(self, path):
  - Time Complexity: O(m), where m is the length of the path. Iterating through the path and splitting it takes linear time.
  - Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of path segments. The list of parts created during splitting has a maximum length of n.
