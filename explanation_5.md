This problem requires to build a Trie data structure connected by TrieNodes. The Trie is represented by root TrieNode and has two functions: inserting a word into the Trie and finding a node representing a given prefix. Each TrieNode consists two parameters: a children dictionary which key could be a character in a English word and "is_word" boolean value to check is the node completes an English word. Each TrieNode has two functions: inserting a character(from a word Trie) to children dictionary and generating list of suffixes of a given prefix TrieNode. 

Time Complexity:

`insert`(Trie): The time complexity of inserting a word into the Trie is O(W), where W is the length of the word. This is because you traverse the Trie character by character, and for each character, you either find an existing node or create a new one.

`find`(for a prefix): The time complexity of searching for a prefix is again O(P), where P is the length of the prefix. You traverse the Trie based on the prefix's characters.

`suffixes`(for a prefix node found by Trie.find): The worst-case time complexity of finding suffixes can be O(N * W), where N is the number of words stored in the Trie and W is the maximum word length. This is because in the worst case, you might need to traverse the entire Trie beneath a prefix to collect all suffixes. However, in practice, the average case is usually better.

`insert`(TrieNode): the time complexity of inserting a character into Trienode is O(1).

Space Complexity:

Worst Case: The worst-case space complexity of a Trie is O(N * W), where N is the number of words and W is the maximum word length. This occurs when all words are unique and don't share common prefixes.

Average Case:  In practice, many words share common prefixes, leading to nodes sharing in the Trie. This often results in a much lower space complexity than the worst case.
