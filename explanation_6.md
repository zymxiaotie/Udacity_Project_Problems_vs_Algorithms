This problem involves an unsorted array of numbers. The goal is to find the minimum and maximum values within this array in O(n) time complexity, ideally in a single traversal.

The approach to solve this problem is to initialize the minimum and maximum values as the first element of the array. As we traverse the array, we compare each element with the current minimum and maximum values.

If an element is smaller than the current minimum, we update the minimum value. Similarly, if an element is larger than the current maximum, we update the maximum value.

Since we perform all these operations in a single traversal of the array, the time complexity is O(n). Furthermore, as we do not define any new array proportional to the size of the input array, the space complexity remains O(1).
